# sbMDI
A simple .Net MDI library with multiple container types.

The goal here is to provide an easily-used approach to approximating the MDI paradigm into modern Xaml/C# projects.

For now WPF is the only target, since I need this for a project I'm involved with. UWP and WinUI3 will come later.

Incorporation is simple. See Test subproject for more details.
