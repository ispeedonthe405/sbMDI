# sbMDI

--------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple .Net MDI library with multiple container types.

The goal here is to provide an easily-used approach to approximating the MDI paradigm in modern Xaml/C# projects.

For now WPF is the only target, since I need this for a project I'm involved with. UWP and WinUI3 will come later.

Integration and usage are simple. See Test subproject for more details.

Current status: Functional, not yet finished.
